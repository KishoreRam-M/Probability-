# Probability Made Super Simple 🎲🍪

## 1️⃣ Multiplicative Rule
**Meaning:** Find the chance of **two things happening together**.  

**Example:**  
- You have a **bag with 2 red balls and 3 blue balls**.  
- Pick **one ball**, then **pick another**.  
- Chance of **red first AND blue second** = chance of red × chance of blue.  

> Think: “What are the chances of both happening?” Multiply them. ✖️

## 2️⃣ Dependent Events
**Meaning:** One event **changes the chance** of the other.  

**Example:**  
- You have a **cookie jar** with 5 cookies.  
- Event A = pick a chocolate cookie 🍫  
- Event B = pick another chocolate cookie **after taking the first one**  
- The chance of picking the second chocolate cookie is **less now** because one cookie is gone.  

> Think: “First choice changes the second choice.” 🔄

---

## 3️⃣ Independent Events
**Meaning:** One event **does NOT change** the chance of the other.  

**Example:**  
- Toss a **coin** two times 🪙  
- Event A = first toss is **heads**  
- Event B = second toss is **heads**  
- The first toss **doesn’t change** the second toss.  

> Think: “First choice doesn’t affect the next choice.” ✅
