# Mutually Exclusive Events

**Mutually Exclusive Events** are events that **cannot happen at the same time**. In other words, if one event occurs, the other **cannot occur**.

## Key Points

- Two events $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive** if:

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = 0
$$

- This means the probability of both happening together is **zero**.

## Example 1: Coin Toss

- Event A = getting **Heads**  
- Event B = getting **Tails**  
- You **cannot get both Heads and Tails** in a single toss.

$$
P(A \text{ and } B) = 0
$$

## Example 2: Rolling a Die

- Event A = rolling an **even number** (2, 4, 6)  
- Event B = rolling an **odd number** (1, 3, 5)  
- A die roll **cannot be both even and odd**, so they are mutually exclusive.

## Formula for Mutually Exclusive Events

For two events $A$ and $B$:

$$
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)
$$

*(No need to subtract $P(A \text{ and } B)$ because itâ€™s 0)*
