# 🎲 Random Experiments, Outcomes, and Events

## 1️⃣ Random Experiment

A **random experiment** is any process or action that gives a **result** but you **cannot predict the outcome with certainty** in advance.

👉 Key points:

* Always repeatable under the same conditions.
* The outcome is **uncertain** but belongs to a known set of possibilities.

✨ Examples:

* Tossing a coin 🪙 → You don’t know if it will be **Heads** or **Tails**.
* Rolling a dice 🎲 → You don’t know which number (1–6) will appear.
* Choosing a card from a deck 🃏 → You don’t know which card will come out.

## 2️⃣ Outcome

An **outcome** is the **result** you get from a random experiment.

👉 Examples:

* Coin toss → **Head** or **Tail**.
* Dice roll → **3** is one possible outcome.
* Drawing a card → **Ace of Hearts** is one outcome.

💡 Think of it as:
**Experiment = action**
**Outcome = result of that action**

---

## 3️⃣ Event

An **event** is a **collection (set) of outcomes** from a random experiment.

👉 Examples:

* Dice roll 🎲:

  * Event A = getting an **even number** → {2, 4, 6}
  * Event B = getting a number **greater than 4** → {5, 6}
* Coin toss 🪙:

  * Event C = getting **a Head** → {Head}
  * Event D = getting **not a Head** → {Tail}
* Card draw 🃏:

  * Event E = drawing a **red card** → {all ♥️ and ♦️}

💡 So:

* **Outcome** = one single result.
* **Event** = group of possible outcomes.

| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Random Experiment | Action with uncertain result | Tossing a coin                         |
| Outcome           | Single possible result       | Getting a Head                         |
| Event             | Set of outcomes              | Getting an even number on dice {2,4,6} |

👉 Super simple analogy:

* **Experiment** = cooking a dish 👨‍🍳
* **Outcome** = the exact taste you get 😋
* **Event** = "good taste" category (could be sweet, salty, spicy — multiple possible outcomes)
