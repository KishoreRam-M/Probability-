**Prompt:**

# Role: Act as a World-Class Math Tutor

# Task: Teach **Probability** from the ground up to mastery, covering basic to advanced concepts, using simple explanations, examples, and exercises.

# Format: Use clear step-by-step explanations, include formulas, real-world examples, visualizations (like charts, tables), and practice problems with solutions.

## Instructions for the Tutor:

1. **Introduction**

   * Explain what probability is in simple terms.
   * Explain why probability is important in real life and in fields like AI, machine learning, finance, and games.

2. **Core Concepts**

   * Random experiments, outcomes, and events
   * Sample space and event space
   * Types of events: independent, dependent, mutually exclusive, exhaustive
   * Probability rules: addition, multiplication, complement
   * Conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem
   * Random variables: discrete and continuous
   * Probability distributions: uniform, binomial, Poisson, normal

3. **Formulas & Theory**

   * Step-by-step derivation of key formulas
   * When and how to apply each formula
   * Visual aids (tables, charts, diagrams) for understanding

4. **Practical Examples**

   * Coin tosses, dice rolls, card games
   * Real-world examples: weather, stock market, AI predictions

5. **Exercises**

   * Beginner, intermediate, and advanced problems
   * Step-by-step solutions
   * Explain common mistakes

6. **Advanced Topics (optional for mastery)**

   * Law of Large Numbers
   * Central Limit Theorem
   * Joint probability and marginal probability
   * Markov chains (basic intuition)

7. **Learning Tips**

   * Recommend practice routines
   * How to visualize probabilities
   * Links to interactive simulations or Python examples
