# Non-Mutually Exclusive Events

## Definition
**Non-mutually exclusive events** are events that **can happen at the same time**.  

> In contrast, **mutually exclusive events** **cannot happen together**.  

**Example:**  
- Event A = “Person likes coffee”  
- Event B = “Person likes tea”  
- A person can **like both coffee and tea**, so these events are **non-mutually exclusive**.  

---

## Probability Formula
For **non-mutually exclusive events** A and B:

\[
P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)
\]

> The last part, \(P(A \text{ and } B)\), is subtracted because these events **can overlap**.  

---

## Real-Life Example
Suppose in a class of 50 students:  

- 20 like **chocolate** (Event A)  
- 15 like **vanilla** (Event B)  
- 5 like **both chocolate and vanilla**  

Probability a student likes **chocolate or vanilla**:  

\[
P(A \text{ or } B) = \frac{20}{50} + \frac{15}{50} - \frac{5}{50} = \frac{30}{50} = 0.6
\]

So, there’s a **60% chance** a student likes **chocolate or vanilla**.
